The project is focused on mental health in tech.

The primary resources used to understand the deductions of mental health are:

1. Data from Open Source Mental Illness (OSMI) using survey data from year 2019. The survey measures attitudes towards mental health and frequency of mental health disorders in the tech workplace. Used the 2020 OSMI survey as the base to answers relevant questions about mental health in tech workplace.

2. Well-being self assessment tool from livingwell.org. This wellbeing assessment uses the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale (WEMWBS) to measure wellbeing.

Scoring & Interpretation
The WEMWBS is scored by summing the scores for each of the 14 items, which are scored from 1 to 5.

Interpretation
Scores range from 14 to 70 and higher scores indicate greater positive mental wellbeing.
The WEMWBS has been compared with a measure of depression, the Centre for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D). This suggest that a WEMWBS score of â‰¤40 could indicate high risk of depression as defined by the CES-D.
